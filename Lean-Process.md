# Lean process
- There are three steps for a startup
- Step 1: Problem / Solution fit
- Step 2: Product / Market fit
- Step 3: Growth
- Before Stage 2, a startup must maximize the learning.
- Pick **bold outcomes**
   - Change the landing page instead of changing the color of a button.
   - Experiment with different UVPs for different customer segments instead tweaking a UVP for a single customer segment.
   - **UVP**: **U**nique **V**alue **P**roposition



# Experiments
- Pivot experiment: It attempts to validate parts of the business model hypotheses
   - Useful to find a plan that works. 
- Optimization experiment: It attempts to refine parts of the business model hypotheses.
   - Useful to accelerate a working plan. 
  
# Iteration Meta-Pattern
- An iteration strings multiple experiments together toward achieving a specific goal

It can be divided in two:
- Understand the problem -> Define the solution: Problem / Solution Fit
- Validate Qualitatively(micro) -> Validate Quantitatively(macro): Product / Market Fit

# Customers
Two types of customers
- Users: They use your product
- Customers: They pay for your product
- Distinguish between users and customers
- Split customer segments in smaller ones
- Put all the customer segments in a single Lean Canvas
- Create a Lean Canvas for each customer segment

# Canvas
- Sketch the first canvas in less than 15 minutes
- Identify the riskiest part
- Go out of the building
- You can leave some part blank

### Canvas Sequence
- Problem: Find the top 3 problems
- Customer Segments: Find the target customers
- UVP: Single, clear, compelling message that states why you are different and worth buying
- Solution: Top 3 features
- Channels: Path to customers
- Revenue Streams: Revenue model, lifetime value, Revenue, Gross Margin
- Cost structure: Customer Acquisition Costs, Distributing costs, Hosting, People
- Key metrics: Key activities you measure
- Unfair advantage: Can't be easily copied

# Problems and Customers
- List the three top problems
- List the existing alternatives
- Identify different user roles
- Narrow down the customer segment: find the early adopter

# Unique Value Proposition (UVP)
- **Why you are different and worth getting attention**
- Be different: Derive your UVP from your top one problem
- Target early adopters
- Focus on finished story benefits: focus on the benefits after the user has used the product
    - Feature: Professionally designed templates
    - Benefit: eye-catching CV that stand out
    - Story: Landing your dream job
    - Instant Clarity Headline = End Result Customer Wants + Specific Period of Time + Address the Objections
- Answer what, who, why
- Create a high-concept pitch

# Solution
- Sketch out the simplest thing you could build for each problem

# Channels
- Use any possible channel to get in front of customers
- Free versus paid
    - There is no free channel
    - Free Channels
       - SEO
       - Blogging
       - Social Media
    - Paid channels
       - SEM (Google Adwords)
- Inbound versus outbound
    - Inbound (Pull messanging)
        - Blogs
        - SEO
        - EBooks
        - Whitepapers
        - Webinars
    - Outbound (Push messaging)
        - SEM
        - Print / TV Ads
        - Trade shows
        - Cold calling
        - Interviews
- Direct versus automated
    - First sell manually, then automate.
- Direct versus indirect
    - Wait about partners
- Retention versus referral
    - Need to have a product worth spreading first

# Revenue
- Charge from day one.
- You can defer pricing for accelerate initial learning
- Lowering signup friction
    - Lack of strong customer commitment
- Price is part of the product
- Price defines your customers
- Being paid is a first form of validation

# Cost structure
- What will cost to interview people?
- What will cost to create the first MVP?
- What is your ongoing burn rate?
- Use revenue stream / cost structure to calculate the break-even point

# Key metrics
- Pirate metrics (AARRR)
    - Acquisition: Turn an unaware visitor into an interested prospect
    - Activation: The interested customer has his first gratifying user experience
    - Retention: Engagement with the product
    - Revenue: Revenue measures the events that get you paid.
    - Referral: Happy customers refer or drive potential prospects into your conversion funnel

# Unfair advantage
- What it is not: lines of code, passion, "first-mover", etc..
- A real unfair advantage is something that cannot be easily copied or bought.
- Examples:
    - Insider information
    - The right “expert” endorsements
    - A dream team
    - Personal authority
    - Large network effects
    - Community
    - Existing customers
    - SEO ranking
