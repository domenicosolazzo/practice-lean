# Lean process
- There are three steps for a startup
- Step 1: Problem / Solution fit
- Step 2: Product / Market fit
- Step 3: Growth


- Before Stage 2, a startup must maximize the learning.
- Pick **bold outcomes**
   - Change the landing page instead of changing the color of a button.
   - Experiment with different UVPs for different customer segments instead tweaking a UVP for a single customer segment.
   - **UVP**: **U**nique **V**alue **P**roposition



# Experiments
- Pivot experiment: It attempts to validate parts of the business model hypotheses
   - Useful to find a plan that works. 
- Optimization experiment: It attempts to refine parts of the business model hypotheses.
   - Useful to accelerate a working plan. 
  
# Iteration Meta-Pattern
- An iteration strings multiple experiments together toward achieving a specific goal

It can be divided in two:
- Understand the problem -> Define the solution: Problem / Solution Fit
- Validate Qualitatively(micro) -> Validate Quantitatively(macro): Product / Market Fit

# Customers
Two types of customers
- Users: They use your product
- Customers: They pay for your product
- Distinguish between users and customers
- Split customer segments in smaller ones
- Put all the customer segments in a single Lean Canvas
- Create a Lean Canvas for each customer segment

# Canvas
- Sketch the first canvas in less than 15 minutes
- Identify the riskiest part
- Go out of the building
- You can leave some part blank

### Canvas Sequence
- Problem: Find the top 3 problems
- Customer Segments: Find the target customers
- UVP: Single, clear, compelling message that states why you are different and worth buying
- Solution: Top 3 features
- Channels: Path to customers
- Revenue Streams: Revenue model, lifetime value, Revenue, Gross Margin
- Cost structure: Customer Acquisition Costs, Distributing costs, Hosting, People
- Key metrics: Key activities you measure
- Unfair advantage: Can't be easily copied

# Problems and Customers
- List the three top problems
- List the existing alternatives
- Identify different user roles
- Narrow down the customer segment: find the early adopter
