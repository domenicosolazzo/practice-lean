# Experiment
- Maximize for Learning, Speed, Focus
- Identify a single metric
- Do the smallest thing to learn
- Formulate a Falsifiable Hypothesis
   - A falsifiable hypothesis is a statement that can be clearly proven wrong.
   - It must be specific and testable
   - Falsifiable Hypothesis = [Specific Repeatable Action] will [Expected Measurable Outcome]
- You do not need much data at the beginning
- Five interviews could be enough
- Correlate results to specific actions
   - Qualitative: Run the experiments in the same way
   - Quantitative: Cohort analysis / Split-testing
- Accessible dashboard
   - Transparency
   - Objectivity
- Communicate progress early and often

# Iteration Meta-Pattern to Risk
- Maximize learning for unit time
- Outline the top three starting risks
   - Problem
   - Channel
   - Revenue Stream
- Stages for tackle each risk
   - Stage 1: Understand the problem
   - Stage 2: Define the solution
      - Demo MVP
      - Will it work?
      - Who is the early adopter?
      - Is pricing working?
   - Stage 3: Validate qualitatively
      - Build MVP
      - Soft launch to the early adopter
      - Do they get the UVP?
      - How do you find enough early adopters?
      - Are you getting paid?
   - Stage 4: Validate quantitatively
      - Launch to a larger audience
      - Have you build something that people want?
      - How will you reach customers at scale?
      - Do you have a viable business?
- By Risk
   - Product Risk
      - First make sure you have a problem worth solving.
      - Define the smallest possible solution (MVP).
      - Build and validate your MVP at small scale (demonstrate UVP).
      - Verify it at large scale
   - Customer Risk
      - First identify who has the pain.
      - Narrow this down to early adopters who really want your product now.
      - Use inbound / outbound channels.
      - Gradually build/develop scalable inbound channels
   - Market Risk
      - Identify competition through existing alternatives and pick a price for your solution.
      - Test pricing first by measuring what customers say (verbal commitments).
      - Test pricing by what customers do.
      - Optimize your cost structure to make the business model work.
