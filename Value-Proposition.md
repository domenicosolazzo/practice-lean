#### Patients
As it relates to the **Patients**, there are three key components for a Value Proposition:

1. **Utility**: Patient-Buyers, like all consumers, will justify a purchase because you solve their particular Job to be done (**JTBD**).
2. **Influence**: Patient-Buyers will also justify a purchase because they are persuaded to it through Key Influencers, such as their providers or purveyors.
3. **Need**: Patient-Buyers will also justify a purchase because a Key Partner in the process of their healthcare decision-making has required your solution as part of their own Value Proposition.

#### Providers
As it relates to the **Providers**, there are four key components for a Value Proposition:

1.Utility: Provider-Buyers, like all consumers, will justify a purchase because you solved their particular JTBD.
2.Reduce Costs: Provider-Buyers will also justify a purchase because your solution reduces their healthcare provisioning costs – either directly or from productivity increases.
3.Increase Revenue: Provider-Buyers will justify a purchase because your solution increases their revenues by increasing the volume of patients throughout.  This allows for more higher-priced services, or increased customer (patient) loyalty.  Moreover, the new Accountable Care organizations can actually result in increased revenue for a Provider-Buyer as they reduce costs.
4.Need: Provider-Buyers will also justify a purchase because in the creation of their own Value Proposition an Externality (usually the Government in the form of CMS or state licensing agencies) requires it.
As it relates to the Payers, there are four key components for a Value Proposition:

#### Payer-Buyers
1.Utility: Payer-Buyers, like all consumers and some government and business buyers, will justify a purchase because it solves their particular JTBD.
2.Reducing Costs: Payer-Buyers, like health insurers and employers, will justify a purchase because your solution reduces their healthcare converge costs – either directly or from productivity increases.
3.Increasing Revenue: Payer-Buyers, like health insurers or growing third-party partners, will justify a purchase because your solution increases their revenues through volume of sales, a price increase, and/or increased customer loyalty.
4.Need: Patient-Buyers will also justify a purchase because in the creation of their own Value Proposition an Externality (usually the Government in the form of CMS or state insurance regulators) requires it.
As it relates to the Purveyors, there are three key components for a Value Proposition:

#### Purveyor-Buyers
1.Reducing Costs: Purveyor-Buyers, like pharmaceutical and durable medical equipment companies, will justify a purchase because your solution reduces their costs – either directly, though cheaper access to Patients, Providers, or Payers, or from productivity increases.
2.Increasing Revenue: Purveyor-Buyers, like pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies, will justify a purchase because your solution increases their revenues through volume of sales, a price increase, and/or increased customer loyalty.
3.Need: Purveyor-Buyers will also justify a purchase because in the creation of their own Value Proposition an Externality (usually the Government in the form of CMS or the FDA) requires it.

## Understanding How Your Product Fits into Your Customer’s Value Drivers
- Do the Benefits provided by your product Features add to your Value Proposition? 
- Do the services you provide augment your product Features?  
- Does the information used to support usage of your products and services speak to the Value Proposition or something else? 
- How many of your product Features and Benefits are really important to your Customer Segments? 
- How many are inconsequential? 
- How many are actually creating a negative impact?

### Type of health product and services
There are three typo of health services: **health direct**, **health related**, **health relevant**

#### Health Direct
Products and services that directly affect a person’s health can be thought of as Health Direct.
Some simple examples include immunizations and vaccinations. 
Some more complex examples are those items prescribed by a doctor to solve the JTBD of a particular health issue such as drugs, therapies, and durable medical equipment.

#### Health Related
Products and services that are used to maintain or improve overall health, but not necessarily address a particular medical JTBD (condition) can be thought of as Health Related. 
Some examples include “wellness” products like screenings, massage, personal training, and supplements.

#### Health Relevant
Products and services that are health and wellness related, but can be bought for usage in other areas, are considered Health Relevant. 
An example is a pair of running shoes bought for their aesthetic value more than their connection to personal training, but can be used for that purpose as well.

### In Context or Opportunistic
Good and services can be considered in context or opportunistic

#### In Context
Products and services that can be recommended as part of a specific JTBD are considered In-context of that JTBD. 
This is consistent with the Value Proposition generation model described above. 
For example, that same pair of running shoes are in-context with the JTBD of getting regular exercise as part of a Doctor-prescribed Key Behavior for a User with high cholesterol.

#### Opportunistic
Products and services that are not part of a specific JTBD (Health Direct, Related, or Relevant) but are still valuable to a User’s total health (as described the in the wellbeing model above) can be considered Opportunistic. 
For example, a User with a JTBD of financial security would be interested in the In-context product of ID Theft Protection. 
It would be reasonable and relevant to approach this same User with the Opportunistic product of Social Media Reputation Management though the underlying connection between financial security and personal information security.
